This project, "Rc Hackathon," was initiated by the coding & robotics club of our university, where I serve as the club president and member. We noticed that students studying programming, particularly Python, already have a certain level of knowledge and understanding. However, to become experts, they need to hone their programming skills further to achieve the highest level of proficiency. Additionally, to enhance students' programming abilities and problem-solving skills, we organized this project. The aim is to provide students with opportunities to practice programming and solve challenges presented in various problem statements.
